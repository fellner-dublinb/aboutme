I started performing in musicals when I was in third grade.  In my first musical I have ever auditioned for, I landed the lead role.  I continued pursuing my interest in theater, and have performed in about 20 musicals so far.  Besides musicals, I have performed in showcases and recitals for both dance and music.  I take many dance and acting classes to improve this passion.

When I was five years old, my mother enrolled me in a gymnastics camp.  It came naturally to me and I was invited to join the Junior Olympics Gymnastics Team.  I trained with this team for seven years, and left during the eighth grade.  I continue to take classes and use gymnastics skills in dance.

There are many extra curricular activities that I enjoy in high school.  I participated in many school musicals, playing the leads in some and getting to feature my dance skills in others. I am president of the environmental club and dance captain of the dance team.  This coming year I get to utilize my creative abilities to choreograph many hip hop dances for my dance team.  Other activities include: engineering club, lighting crew, school newspaper, Witness Theater and track team.  Involving myself in many activities gives me a sense of accomplishment and joy.  I am glad to be doing as much as I can in high school.
